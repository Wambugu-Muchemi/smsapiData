# smsapiData
This code pulls data from API served by Africas Talking website. The Data is sent to a csv file. The aim is to update the csv with live data by automating the script to run every minute wich will be achieved via a cron job. The data will then be sourced from the csv by a web app.
Can now query for sms code via querybynumber.py
